# Modern Clock

I created a sleek and responsive digital clock using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, featuring seamless animations that integrate with the gradient and clock for a polished UI. It functions flawlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.

## How to Use:

To ensure that the HTML file loads correctly and to facilitate ease of editing, it is imperative to **use a Web Server**, such as the one available in VSCode, as **opposed to simply opening the file in Chrome**, as the latter may result in incorrect loading and cause unnecessary difficulties during the editing process.

## Features:

-   Easy-to-use interface
-   A digital clock that displays the time in hours, minutes, and seconds
-   A toggle button that switches between 12-hour and 24-hour time format
-   A background gradient that changes color over time
-   Responsive design for mobile devices
